# VAN-LIFE RENTAL APPLICATION

## DESCRIPTION

This codebase establishes a full-stack simulation of a van rental application, combining Mirage.js for the server-side and React with React Router for the client-side. It serves as a foundation for building a genuine application, with the server emulating the backend and the client-side code responsible for frontend logic and views.

### SERVER-SIDE OVERVIEW

Server (Mirage.js):

Defines mock API routes and data models, including vans and users.
Seeds the server with initial data for vans and users.
Sets up API routes and handlers for responses, including van listings, user authentication, and more.

### CLIENT-SIDE OVERVIEW

Client-Side Application (React and React Router):

Implements client-side routing for different application views.
Offers routes for the home page, about page, login page, van listings, van detail page, and host-related pages (dashboard, income, reviews, etc.).
Supports data loading and actions with route-specific loaders.
Renders user interfaces and views for the van rental application.
Usage
This codebase can serve as a starting point for creating a fully functional van rental application. Developers can extend and customize the server and client-side components to build a real-world application with authentication, user interactions, and dynamic data.

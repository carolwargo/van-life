# host/vans/:id

Your /host/vans/:id needs to be the parent route of the other
nested routes /host/vans/:id/pricing and /host/vans/:id/photos.
The detailed info view should show up at /host/vans/:id; in other
words, it should be the default view that shows up near the bottom
when someone clicks on a van from /host/vans.
